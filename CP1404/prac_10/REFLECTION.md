## Estimates for Practical Tasks
When it comes to estimating the time required for practical tasks, my accuracy varied throughout the subject. Initially, I found it challenging to accurately estimate the time needed for each task. However, as I gained more experience and became familiar with the complexity of different tasks, my accuracy improved. I learned to break down tasks into smaller subtasks, which helped me estimate more accurately. Overall, I observed a positive trend in my accuracy as I progressed through the subject.

## Code Reviews
Participating in code reviews, both as a reviewer and being reviewed, has been a valuable learning experience. As a reviewer, I learned the importance of providing constructive feedback that is specific, actionable, and respectful. It helped me improve my ability to identify potential issues, suggest improvements, and consider alternative approaches. Being on the receiving end of code reviews exposed me to different perspectives and coding practices, which broadened my understanding and helped me identify areas for improvement in my own code. It also emphasized the significance of writing clear and well-documented code to facilitate the review process.

## Practical Tasks Overall
If I were in charge of the subject, there are a few changes I would consider for the practical tasks. Firstly, providing more explicit instructions or guidelines in certain areas where students often struggle would be helpful. Additionally, incorporating more real-world scenarios or practical applications into the tasks could enhance the relevance and engagement of the subject. Finally, offering more opportunities for hands-on coding exercises and mini-projects could further reinforce the learning outcomes and provide practical experience.
